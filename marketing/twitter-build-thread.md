**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I'm building a platform that deploys AI agents in 30 seconds.

No config files. No server setup. No CLI.

Just pick a model, connect your channels, and hit deploy.

It's called ClawHQ. Here's the story 🧵

---

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
The problem: setting up an AI agent today takes HOURS.

Config files, API keys, server provisioning, channel tokens, SSL certs...

Most people give up before they ever get a working agent.

The tools that exist to simplify this? Thin wrappers. No real deployment. No isolation.

---

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
ClawHQ gives every user their own Docker container.

Real deployment. Real isolation. Persistent memory. Health monitoring. Auto-restart.

Not a proxy. Not a wrapper. An actual AI command center.

---

**Tweet 4 (Features):**
What you get:

→ 5 models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok)
→ 5 channels (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, iMessage)
→ White-label (your brand, your domain)
→ Bundled API OR bring your own keys
→ Deploy in ~30 seconds

**Tweet 5 (Market):**
The leading competitor in this space does $18K MRR with 400+ users.

The founder is trying to sell the business.

That tells me two things:
1. The market is real
2. The execution ceiling is low

I'm going after the gap they left open.

---

**Tweet 6 (Differentiator):**
The gap: white-label.

No existing platform lets agencies rebrand and resell AI agents under their own domain.

ClawHQ does. Business tier = your brand, your domain, zero ClawHQ branding.

That's the moat.

**Tweet 7 (Pricing):**
Pricing:

🆓 Free — 1 agent, 1 channel, 100 msgs/day
💎 Pro ($19/mo) — 3 agents, all channels, 5K msgs/day
🏢 Business ($49/mo) — 10 agents, white-label, SSO

Founding member pricing locked in for life. Limited slots.

---

**Tweet 8 (CTA):**
Currently in pre-launch. Waitlist is open.

If you want to deploy an AI agent without the pain, check it out:

→ clawhq.dev

Early beta testers get founding member pricing (locked forever).

DMs open if you have questions. Let's build. 🚀

**Tweet 9 (Engagement):**
What features would make this a must-have for you?

Genuinely want to know. Building this in public means building it WITH you.
