## 📝 Description (Product Hunt listing body)

### The Problem
Deploying an AI agent today means juggling API keys, setting up servers, wiring messaging channels, and babysitting infrastructure. Most founders spend weeks on plumbing instead of building their product.

### The Solution
**ClawHQ is a one-click AI command center.** Pick a model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok), connect a channel (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, iMessage), and you're live in 30 seconds.

### What makes ClawHQ different?

🚀 **30-Second Deploy** — Name your agent, pick a model, connect a channel. Done.

🎨 **White-Label Ready** — Custom branding, custom domains, remove all ClawHQ branding. Resell AI agents under your own brand. (Business tier)

📱 **Every Channel** — Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, iMessage — one agent, all platforms, one dashboard.

🧠 **Any Model** — Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok. Switch models with one click. Bring your own keys or use our bundled API.

💾 **Persistent Memory** — Your agents remember context across restarts. No more goldfish bots.

📊 **Full Dashboard** — Real-time health monitoring, usage stats, logs, start/stop/restart controls.

💰 **Simple Pricing** — Free tier to start. Pro at $19/mo. Business at $49/mo. No surprise bills.

### Who is this for?
- **Solopreneurs** who want an AI assistant without DevOps
- **Agencies** who want to resell white-labeled AI agents
- **Businesses** who need AI on their existing channels
- **Developers** who want to skip the boilerplate

### Built with
OpenClaw (open-source AI agent framework), React, TypeScript, Docker, Stripe

## 💬 Maker's First Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm King, and I built ClawHQ because I was tired of spending days wiring up AI agents when the actual setup should take minutes.

The AI agent space is exploding, but deploying one still feels like 2015-era cloud computing — too many moving parts, too much config, too much babysitting.

ClawHQ fixes that. Pick a model. Pick a channel. Click deploy. Your agent is live.

What I'm most excited about is **white-label support**. If you're an agency or consultant, you can deploy AI agents under your own brand with your own domain. No "Powered by ClawHQ" anywhere. Your clients think it's your platform.

We're launching with a **Founding Member deal** — early supporters get locked-in pricing that won't go up, ever. Limited slots.

I'd love your feedback. What channels do you want us to add next? What features would make this a must-have for you?

Let's go 🚀
