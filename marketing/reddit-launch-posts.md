## Post 1: r/SaaS

**Title:** I built ClawHQ — deploy AI agents in 30 seconds, no coding required (free tier included)

**Body:**

Hey r/SaaS 👋

I've been building AI agents for a while and kept running into the same problem: the deployment part sucks. You get your agent working locally, then spend days wiring up hosting, channels, monitoring, billing... it's a nightmare.

So I built **ClawHQ** ([clawhq.dev](https://clawhq.dev)) — a platform that lets you deploy a fully functional AI agent in 30 seconds. Pick your model, connect your channels, hit deploy. Done.

**What it does:**
- **One-click deploy** — Choose Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, or Grok. Your agent is live in seconds.
- **All channels** — Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, iMessage. Connect once, works everywhere.
- **White-label ready** — Custom branding, custom domains. Your clients never see "ClawHQ."
- **BYOK or bundled** — Bring your own API keys, or just pay one bill. No juggling 5 dashboards.
- **Real-time monitoring** — Health checks, usage stats, auto-restart on crashes. Sleep at night.

**Pricing:**
- Free: 1 agent, 1 channel, 100 msgs/day (no credit card)
- Pro: $19/mo — 3 agents, all channels, 5K msgs/day
- Business: $49/mo — 10 agents, white-label, SSO, 25K msgs/day

**Why not just self-host?** You totally can. ClawHQ is built on OpenClaw (open source). But if you want managed hosting, multi-channel support, white-labeling for clients, and usage billing — that's the gap we fill.

**What I'd love feedback on:**
1. Does the pricing feel right?
2. Any channels you'd want that we're missing?
3. Would you use white-label to resell to your own clients?

Happy to answer any questions. Thanks for reading! 🙏

## Post 2: r/Entrepreneur

**Title:** From side project to SaaS — I'm launching a platform to deploy AI agents in 30 seconds

**Body:**

I'm a college student who's been deep in the AI agent space. I noticed something: tons of people want AI agents for their business, but the technical barrier is massive. Docker, API keys, hosting, channel integrations — it's a full-time job just to get something running.

**The opportunity:** There are 100M+ businesses that could use an AI agent but have zero technical ability to deploy one. The existing solutions are either too technical or way overpriced.

So I built **ClawHQ** ([clawhq.dev](https://clawhq.dev)).

**The pitch:** Deploy an AI agent in 30 seconds. No coding. Pick your model (Claude, GPT, etc.), connect your channels (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord), customize the personality, and hit go. 

**Business model:**
- Free tier to get people in the door
- $19/mo Pro (most individuals)
- $49/mo Business (agencies + white-label)
- Enterprise: custom

**The white-label angle is key.** Agencies can deploy AI agents for their clients under their own brand. The client never sees ClawHQ. The agency charges whatever they want. We handle the infrastructure.

**Current status:** Landing page live, waitlist growing, core platform functional. Looking for early users and feedback.

**Competitive landscape:** There are a few wrappers out there (SimpleClaw, ClawFast, etc.) but most are thin shells with no real moat. We're going deeper — white-label, multi-channel, enterprise features, and actual infrastructure.

Would love to hear thoughts, especially from anyone running an agency or consulting business. Is this something you'd actually use?

## Post 3: r/OpenClaw (or r/ClaudeAI / r/artificial)

**Title:** I built a managed hosting platform for OpenClaw agents — deploy in 30 seconds with multi-channel support

**Body:**

If you've used OpenClaw, you know it's incredible. But getting it deployed, keeping it running, and connecting it to multiple channels is still a pain.

I built **ClawHQ** ([clawhq.dev](https://clawhq.dev)) to solve that.

**What it gives you over raw OpenClaw:**
- **Managed hosting** — We handle Docker, scaling, health checks, auto-restart
- **Multi-channel in one click** — Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, iMessage
- **Model switching** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok — swap anytime
- **Usage dashboard** — See your tokens, messages, costs in real-time
- **White-label** — Run agents under your own brand/domain (Business tier)
- **BYOK support** — Use your own API keys if you want full control

**Free tier:** 1 agent, 1 channel, 100 msgs/day. No credit card needed.

It's built WITH OpenClaw, not against it. Think of it like Vercel is to Next.js — the managed layer that makes deployment trivial.

Early access is open. Feedback welcome, especially on what features matter most to you.

## Post 4: r/ChatGPT or r/ClaudeAI (shorter, punchier)

**Title:** Made a tool that deploys AI agents to Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord in 30 seconds — free tier available

**Body:**

Quick show-and-tell:

**ClawHQ** ([clawhq.dev](https://clawhq.dev)) lets you deploy an AI agent that works across Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, and iMessage. Pick your model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.), give it a personality, connect your channels, done.

Free tier: 1 agent, 1 channel, 100 msgs/day.

Built it because I was tired of spending days configuring bots when the AI part took 5 minutes. Figured others felt the same.

Happy to answer questions or take feature requests.

## Posting Strategy

**Timing:** Post on Tuesday or Wednesday morning (9-11 AM EST) for maximum visibility.

**Order:**
1. r/SaaS first (most targeted audience)
2. r/Entrepreneur 2 hours later
3. r/OpenClaw or r/ClaudeAI the next day
4. r/ChatGPT 2 days after launch

**Engagement rules:**
- Reply to EVERY comment in first 2 hours
- Be genuine, not salesy
- Admit limitations honestly ("we don't have X yet, but it's on the roadmap")
- Upvote thoughtful feedback even if critical

**Avoid:**
- Don't post to multiple subreddits on the same day (looks spammy)
- Don't use link shorteners
- Don't astroturf with alt accounts
