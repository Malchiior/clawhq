# ClawHQ Launch Thread (Twitter/X)

## Thread (post on launch day)

**Tweet 1:**
I just launched ClawHQ on @ProductHunt 🚀

Deploy AI agents in 30 seconds. No coding. Any model. Every channel.

Here's why I built it 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The problem: Setting up an AI agent still takes days.

API keys. Server config. Channel wiring. Health monitoring. Billing.

It's like building a car just to drive to the store.

**Tweet 3:**
ClawHQ fixes this:

1️⃣ Name your agent
2️⃣ Pick a model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok)
3️⃣ Connect a channel (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack)

That's it. You're live.

**Tweet 4:**
The killer feature? White-label.

Agencies can deploy AI agents under their own brand. Custom domain. Custom colors. No "Powered by" badge.

Your clients think it's YOUR platform.

**Tweet 5:**
Pricing is dead simple:

🆓 Free — 1 agent, 100 msgs/day
💎 Pro $19/mo — 3 agents, 5K msgs/day
🏢 Business $49/mo — 10 agents, white-label, SSO

No per-token bills. No surprise charges.

**Tweet 6:**
First 100 Pro signups get **Founding Member pricing** — $12/mo locked in forever.

First 50 Business signups — $29/mo forever.

These won't last.

**Tweet 7:**
We're live on Product Hunt today.

If you've ever wanted to deploy an AI agent without the DevOps headache, this is for you.
