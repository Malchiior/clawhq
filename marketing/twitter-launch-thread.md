## Tweet 1 (Hook)

I just built something that lets you deploy an AI agent in 30 seconds.

No coding. No DevOps. No $200/month API bills.

It's called ClawHQ, and here's the entire build story 🧵👇

---

## Tweet 2 (Problem)

The problem: deploying AI agents is a nightmare.

You need:
- Server setup
- API key management
- Channel integrations
- Container orchestration
- Monitoring & health checks

Most people give up before they even start.

---

## Tweet 3 (Solution)

ClawHQ makes it stupid simple:

1. Pick your AI model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok)
2. Connect your channels (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord)
3. Click deploy

That's it. Your agent is live in 30 seconds.

---

## Tweet 4 (Differentiator — White Label)

The killer feature? White-label everything.

Your brand. Your domain. Your colors. Zero ClawHQ branding.

Agencies can resell AI agents under their own name. No one knows it's powered by ClawHQ.

This is what separates us from every other wrapper out there.

---

## Tweet 5 (Tech Stack)

Built with:
- React + Vite + TypeScript (dashboard)
- Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL (backend)
- Docker containers per user (isolation)
- Stripe billing (Free / Pro $19 / Business $49)

Every agent gets its own sandboxed environment. No cross-contamination.

---

## Tweet 6 (Features Flex)

✅ One-click deploy
✅ 5 AI models supported
✅ Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord channels
✅ BYOK or bundled API (one bill)

---

## Tweet 7 (Pricing)

Pricing that doesn't make you cry:

🆓 Free — 1 agent, 1 channel, 100 msgs/day
💎 Pro $19/mo — 3 agents, all channels, 5K msgs/day
🏢 Business $49/mo — 10 agents, white-label, SSO

Founding members get locked-in pricing forever.

---

## Tweet 8 (Competition)

"But there are other OpenClaw wrappers..."

Yeah. I studied them all.

Most are thin wrappers with no moat. One competitor is doing $18K MRR but the founder is already trying to sell.

ClawHQ is built to last: real infrastructure, real isolation, real white-label.

---

## Tweet 9 (Vision)

The vision: become the Vercel of AI agents.

You wouldn't host a website on your laptop. Why host an AI agent on yours?

ClawHQ = one-click deploy, auto-scaling, zero maintenance.
