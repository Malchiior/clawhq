# ClawHQ Influencer Outreach Plan

## 🎯 Goal

>
> Think of it as Vercel for AI agents — one-click deploy with white-label support.

>
> We just launched ClawHQ (clawhq.dev), a platform that lets anyone deploy OpenClaw AI agents in 30 seconds with zero coding. It's like Vercel meets AI:
>

> - **White-label ready** — custom branding, custom domains

## 💰 Budget Considerations
- **Free**: DMs, community engagement, free account giveaways
- **Low ($0-500)**: Affiliate commissions, creator kit production
- **Medium ($500-2000)**: Sponsored YouTube videos (1-2 mid-tier)
- **High ($2000+)**: Fireship/NetworkChuck sponsorship (if budget allows)

**Recommendation**: Start with free outreach (Phase 1-2). Use early traction data to justify paid sponsorships.

## 📝 Key Talking Points for All Outreach
1. **OpenClaw is exploding** — CNBC, Guardian, TechCrunch, IBM all covered it in Feb 2026
2. **Deployment is the bottleneck** — most people can't set up Docker, VPS, API keys
3. **ClawHQ solves it** — 30-second deploy, no coding, all models, all channels
4. **White-label is the moat** — agencies can resell under their own brand
5. **Free tier exists** — low friction to try, easy to recommend
6. **Privacy-first** — containerized isolation per user, no shared data
