# ClawHQ vs SimpleClaw: Why White-Label Matters

*Published: February 2026 | Reading time: 7 min*

**TL;DR:** Both ClawHQ and SimpleClaw offer managed AI agent deployment. But if you're an agency, consultant, or business that wants to offer AI agents under your own brand, ClawHQ's white-label capabilities make it the clear choice.**

## The Managed AI Agent Market in 2026

The demand for AI agents has exploded. Every business wants one — a chatbot for support, an assistant for sales, a moderator for their community. The models are ready. The infrastructure is ready.

What most businesses *aren't* ready for is the deployment complexity.

That's where managed platforms come in. Instead of wrangling Docker containers, API keys, and server configurations, you use a platform that handles everything. Two of the leading options in this space are **ClawHQ** and **SimpleClaw**.

Both platforms let you deploy AI agents without coding. Both support multiple models and channels. But they diverge sharply in one critical area: **white-label support and brand ownership**.

| **Channels** | Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, iMessage | Telegram, Discord, Slack |
| **Persistent memory** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Dashboard & monitoring** | ✅ Full dashboard with health, logs, analytics | ✅ Basic dashboard |
| **White-label branding** | ✅ Full (Business tier) | ❌ |
| **Custom domains** | ✅ | ❌ |

| **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **SSO / Team management** | ✅ (Business tier) | ❌ |
| **Container isolation** | ✅ Per-agent Docker containers | Shared environment |
| **Free tier** | ✅ 1 agent, 100 msgs/day | ✅ 1 agent, 50 msgs/day |
| **Starting price** | $19/mo (Pro) | $15/mo |

Both are solid products for individual users. But the moment you need to **serve clients** or **build a business** on top of AI agents, the differences become deal-breakers.

## Why White-Label Matters

### If You're an Agency

You run a digital marketing agency. A client asks: "Can you set up an AI chatbot for our website?" You say yes.

**With SimpleClaw:** You deploy the agent. It works great. But every interaction shows SimpleClaw branding. Your client's dashboard says "SimpleClaw" at the top. The login page is SimpleClaw's. Your client knows exactly what platform you're using and could bypass you entirely for $15/mo.

**With ClawHQ:** You deploy the agent under your own brand. Your client sees *your* logo, *your* domain, *your* login page. They think it's your proprietary AI platform. You charge them $300/mo. They're happy. You're profitable. Nobody's getting bypassed.

That's the white-label difference. It's not a feature — it's a **business model**.

### If You're a Consultant

You advise businesses on AI adoption. You recommend tools, set up systems, and charge for your expertise.

White-label lets you productize your consulting. Instead of recommending third-party tools (and hoping clients keep paying you), you offer a managed AI service under your brand. Recurring revenue. Sticky clients. Professional positioning.

### If You're a SaaS Founder

You're building a product that includes AI capabilities — maybe a customer support tool, a sales assistant, or an internal knowledge base. You don't want to build AI infrastructure from scratch.

White-label ClawHQ becomes your AI backend. Your users never know ClawHQ exists. They interact with your product, your brand, your experience. You focus on your unique value proposition while ClawHQ handles the AI plumbing.

## The Economics of White-Label

Let's do the math for an agency deploying AI agents for clients:

**Without white-label (SimpleClaw):**
- You pay $15/mo for SimpleClaw
- Client sees SimpleClaw branding
- Client realizes they can do it themselves
- Client churns after 2 months
- Net revenue: ~$0 (you lost the client)

**With white-label (ClawHQ Business):**
- You pay $49/mo for ClawHQ Business (10 agents)
- Each client agent costs you $4.90/mo
- You charge each client $200-500/mo
- 10 clients = $2,000-5,000/mo revenue
- Net profit: $1,951-4,951/mo

**That's a 40-100x return on your ClawHQ subscription.**

The white-label isn't a premium you're paying — it's the foundation of a profitable service business.

## Beyond White-Label: Where ClawHQ Pulls Ahead

### Model Selection

ClawHQ supports five major AI model families: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok. SimpleClaw currently supports two. More models means more flexibility to match the right AI to each use case — and the ability to switch instantly without redeployment.

### Channel Coverage

ClawHQ supports five messaging channels including WhatsApp and iMessage — two of the most-used messaging platforms globally. SimpleClaw covers three. If your clients are in markets where WhatsApp dominates (Latin America, Europe, Southeast Asia), ClawHQ is the only option.

### Security Architecture

ClawHQ runs each agent in an isolated Docker container. This means one agent's data, processes, and potential vulnerabilities are completely separated from every other agent on the platform. SimpleClaw uses a shared environment, which is more cost-efficient but introduces potential cross-contamination risks.

For enterprise and agency use cases, container isolation isn't optional — it's table stakes.

### Team Management & SSO

ClawHQ's Business tier includes SSO and team management features. This matters when you have multiple people managing agents — your operations team, your client's team, or a mix of both. SimpleClaw doesn't offer team features, which limits its usefulness for organizations.

## When SimpleClaw Might Be the Better Choice

To be fair, SimpleClaw has its strengths:

- **Lower starting price** ($15/mo vs $19/mo) — if budget is the primary concern
- **Simpler interface** — fewer features can mean less complexity for solo users
- **Adequate for personal use** — if you just want a personal AI assistant on Telegram

If you're deploying one agent for yourself and don't care about branding, SimpleClaw gets the job done at a slightly lower price.

But the moment your needs grow beyond personal use, you'll hit SimpleClaw's ceiling. No white-label. Fewer models. Fewer channels. No team management. No container isolation.

## The Bottom Line

ClawHQ and SimpleClaw both solve the same core problem: making AI agent deployment easy. For personal, single-agent use, either works fine.

But if you're building a business — whether you're an agency reselling AI services, a consultant productizing your expertise, or a SaaS founder embedding AI capabilities — white-label support isn't a nice-to-have. It's the difference between a tool you use and a platform you build on.

ClawHQ gives you that platform.

| | SimpleClaw | ClawHQ |
|---|-----------|--------|
| **Best for** | Personal use, hobbyists | Agencies, businesses, power users |
| **Brand** | Their brand | Your brand |
| **Growth ceiling** | Low | High |
| **Revenue potential** | None | $2K-5K+/mo per 10 clients |
| **Security** | Shared | Isolated containers |
